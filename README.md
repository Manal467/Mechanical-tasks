# 5-DOF Robotic Arm Project  
**Mechanical Tasks Series - Task 1**  

Design and implementation of a 3D-robotic arm with 5 degrees of freedom (5DOF) for mechanical tasks.  

## What the project does
This project controls a 5-degree-of-freedom robotic arm for movements and object handling.

## Why the project is useful
- Teaches robotics basics
- Can be used for small automation tasks
- Accessible robotic arm platform for education and prototyping

## Getting started
Follow these simple steps to run the robotic arm simulation in Tinkercad:

### Prerequisites
- A free [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/) account
- Web browser (Chrome/Firefox/Edge recommended)
